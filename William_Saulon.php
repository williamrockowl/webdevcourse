        <h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my About Me Page. My name's William Saulon
            and I'm currently a full time student at <mark class="red">ECC</mark>.
            The reason I decided on taking this course, was
            to further my knowledge on full stack development. I've always enjoyed code and its infinite
            capabilities. There is truely so much you can do with code and you can never get tired of it.
            The tech world has so much opportunities career-wise as well as the impact it can have on the world.
            Personally, I'd want to create a start up company from the very bottom. Before that, I would want to have
            experience in
            Web Design, CyberSecurity, Game Development, and possibly work for a big name company like <mark
                class="blue">FaceBook</mark>
            or <mark class="green">Google</mark>. Eventually, I would also want to go into the medical aspect of code
            that would help
            hospitals and doctors create new technology that can potentially save lives that we aren't able to save now.

        <h1>HISTORY:</h1>
        <p> I was born on August 1999 in Queens, NY. I grew up with my parents and my little sister who was born two
            years
            after me. For elementary school, I went to PS20 while also attending a afternoon camp due to my parents
            working all the way
            in NYC. Growing up I would always be playing basketball, during lunch breaks in elementary I'd go straight
            for the basketball
            and shoot around with some friends. As I reached middle school, my living situations got worse and worse.
            The community turned
            south which caused a lot of panic in my family. After two years of being at IS237, my family decided it was
            time to move to a
            better location where I'd finish my last year of middle school. We moved to Long Island, NY which was a
            40-60 min drive from where I originially grew
            up. Everyone was super nice to me but it wasn't hard to tell that the friend groups around me weren't made
            in a year. I eventually
            was able to break out of my shell and started having fun. Entering High School, I made so many friends as
            well as built a lot
            of relationships with my teachers and advisors. I ended up joining the Baseball team as well as an AAU
            Basketball team, while being part of Mathletes
            and Yearbook Club. After HS I attended NYiT, then transferred to UB but decided to save money at ECC.
